            Vether is designed to be a store-of-value with properties of strict scarcity,
            unforgeable costliness and a fixed emission schedule. Vether mimics
            characteristics of Bitcoin, where miners compete to expend capital to acquire
            newly-minted coins and chase ever-decreasing margins.  Instead of expending capital,
            Vether participants compete to purchase it by destroying capital on-chain.
            As a result, all units of Vether are acquired at-cost and by anyone.
            This mechanism is called Proof-of-Value.
